/*Think about your favorite apps, and pick one that stores your data- like a game that stores scores, 
an app that lets you post updates, etc. Now in this project, you're going to imagine that the app 
stores your data in a SQL database (which is pretty likely!), and write SQL statements that might look like their own SQL.*/

CREATE a table to store the data.
INSERT a few example rows in the table.
Use an UPDATE to emulate what happens when you edit data in the app.
Use a DELETE to emulate what happens when you delete data in the app.
SELECT * FROM cricket;
UPDATE cricket set runs = 0 WHERE id=5;
SELECT * FROM cricket;
DELETE FROM cricket WHERE id=8;
SELECT * FROM cricket;
